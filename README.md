Basically this javascript AJAX page proves you can get individual data from the reams of information colleted by IP camera from all your phones sensors.


Using the amazing wifi IP Camera for Android at

And then the App main page on your Android cell phone looks like this

Basic operation is to use the main webpage using the URL gaven to you on the main IP Camera page

example 

http://255.1.1.1:8080       Make sure you are on a wifi network. Not really sure what happens when you are using your cells data.

 and then click on the circled open sensor graph. To see all the data generated by your cell phone.
 
 My Code in this repostory helps you access the data using a webpage.

And here is what the web page looks like when it has extracted data from the IP camera.

Note the single gravity X mesurement and then the range of more complex items.
